            <h1>Me</h1>
            <p>I was born in Baku, Azerbaijan. I enjoy web development and software engineering, and I actively build small projects to improve my skills. Outside of programming, I have a strong interest in chemical engineering. I have participated in Teknofest, gaining valuable experience in technology and innovation projects, and I have earned two bronze medals in national chemistry olympiads (RFO), which strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills.

                In my free time, I enjoy reading manga, building Lego sets, and collecting comics. These hobbies allow me to explore my creativity and attention to detail in a fun and relaxing way.</p>
